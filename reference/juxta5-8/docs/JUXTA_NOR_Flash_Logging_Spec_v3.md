# Flash Layout

## Partition Scheme

| Region | Purpose | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 0x000000 - 0x00FFFF | Metadata / config | 64 KB |
| 0x010000 - 0x01FFFF | JXS settings/events | 64 KB |
| 0x020000 - 0x11FFFF | JXV vitals log | 1024 KB |
| 0x120000 - 0x3FFFFF | JXB BLE observations | 3008 KB |

### Rationale

- Vitals are predictable and low bandwidth
- BLE observations are variable and dominate storage in dense environments
- Settings/events are tiny but critical for experiment provenance
- Current operating settings are cached in config memory for fast access

---

# File Types

The system exposes pseudo-files during transfer/export.

Each file is append-only.

Each file physically stores:

1. Filename
2. CSV header
3. Data rows
4. EOF marker

This fully embraces a CSV-in-flash architecture.

Advantages:

- Self-describing logs
- No schema reconstruction
- No schema registry logic
- Easier debugging
- Easier firmware migration
- Easier raw flash recovery

# File Structure

Example physical flash contents:

```text
JXV20260507.csv
unix,motion,batt_v,temp_c
1715200000,12,3.81,24
1715200060,14,3.80,24
#EOF
```

**Juxta5-8 production** keeps JXV (and JXB) as strict CSV — a single column header followed by data rows only. The NVS snapshot lives in the JXS `day_start` row at the head of each day's JXS file (see the JXS section below), so every day is interpretable from JXS alone without hunting historical files.

---

# 1. Vitals Log (`JXV`)

## Filename

```text
JXVYYYYMMDD.csv
```

Example:

```text
JXV20260507.csv
```

## Schema

```csv
unix,motion,batt_v,temp_c
```

JXV holds **only** the column header and data rows — no comment lines, no metadata. NVS provenance is recorded in the JXS `day_start` row at the head of each day's JXS file (see the JXS section below). Vitals timestamps share a calendar day with their day's JXS, so cross-referencing the two requires only matching by date.

## Example Rows

```csv
1715200000,12,3.81,24
1715200060,14,3.80,24
1715200120,13,3.80,24
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| unix | Unix timestamp in seconds |
| motion | Motion count (0–255) |
| batt_v | Battery voltage as decimal volts |
| temp_c | Integer temperature in Celsius |

## Temperature Source

The LIS2DH12TR temperature sensor is 8-bit resolution.

Temperature is stored as integer Celsius.

Example:

```text
24 = 24°C
```

## Logging Rate

```text
1 row per minute
```

---

# 2. BLE Observation Log (`JXB`)

## Filename

```text
JXBYYYYMMDD.csv
```

Example:

```text
JXB20260507.csv
```

## Schema

```csv
unix,observer_id,peer_id,rssi
```

## Example Rows

```csv
1715200000,JX_9B10A1,JX_3FA2B7,-68
1715200030,JX_9B10A1,JX_2C77D4,-74
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| unix | Unix timestamp in seconds |
| observer_id | Device performing scan |
| peer_id | Observed BLE device ID |
| rssi | RSSI in dBm |

## Logging Behavior

A row is created for every observed BLE advertisement match.

If multiple peers are observed during a scan window, multiple rows are written.

## BLE Identity Rules

BLE advertising names represent stable hardware identities.

Required format:

```text
JX_000000
```

Where:

```text
000000 = last 6 hex characters of BLE MAC address
```

Example:

```text
JX_3FA2B7
```

Advantages:

- Deterministic
- Stable
- Human-readable
- Derived directly from hardware identity
- No stored lookup table required

## Important Design Rule

`subject_id` is NEVER used as BLE advertising name.

Reason:

- Devices may be swapped between subjects during experiments
- Hardware identity must remain stable across subject reassignment
- Prevents BLE name caching ambiguity
- Preserves historical continuity

## Scan Rate Assumption

```text
1 scan every 30 seconds
average 1 peer observed per scan
```

---

# 3. Settings / Events Log (`JXS`)

## Filename

```text
JXSYYYYMMDD.csv
```

Example:

```text
JXS20260507.csv
```

## Purpose

Tracks:

- Subject assignment
- Experiment assignment
- Firmware version
- Configuration changes
- Mode changes
- System events
- Time changes
- Experiment provenance

This file is critical for downstream analysis.

## Schema

```csv
unix,event,device_id,subject_id,experiment,fw_version,mode,scan_interval_s,vitals_interval_s,ble_name
```

The **`mode`** column name is retained for schema compatibility. **Juxta5-8** firmware does not store or vary operating mode; every JXS row uses the literal **`normal`**.

**Juxta5-8 production firmware** (`applications/juxta5-8-prod`, `JUXTA_LOG_SCHEMA` `jxta-nor-csv-v5`): JXS rows omit `mode` and include **`adv_interval_s`** after **`scan_interval_s`**:  
`unix,event,device_id,subject_id,experiment,fw_version,scan_interval_s,adv_interval_s,vitals_interval_s,ble_name`.

**Day-start row**: each time `juxta5-8-prod` creates a new JXS pseudo-file (first
boot of a region, calendar rollover, or after a `clearMemory` erase), it
auto-emits a single `day_start` row that snapshots current NVS via the JXS
columns (`subject_id`, `experiment`, intervals, `ble_name`). This makes each
day's data interpretable from JXS alone — downstream tools never need to chase
prior days for subject or interval context. It also restores the strict
single-header CSV contract that the legacy JXV `#device_settings` comment
lines broke.

## Example Rows

```csv
1715200000,day_start,JX_9B10A1,mouse_07,social_v1,1.2.3,normal,30,60,JX_9B10A1
1715200000,boot,JX_9B10A1,mouse_07,social_v1,1.2.3,normal,30,60,JX_9B10A1
1715220000,settings_changed,JX_9B10A1,mouse_07,social_v1,1.2.3,normal,10,60,JX_9B10A1
1715260000,subject_changed,JX_9B10A1,mouse_08,social_v1,1.2.3,normal,30,60,JX_9B10A1
```

## Logged Events

Recommended events (the `juxta5-8-prod` implementation uses the lifecycle vocabulary
described below; other firmwares may use a subset or extend it):

```text
day_start
shelf_exit
user_connected
time_set
user_disconnected
boot
shelf_entry
settings_changed
low_battery
wdt_recovery_dog
wdt_recovery_sreq
wdt_recovery_lockup
wdt_recovery_no_rtc
reset
mode_changed
subject_changed
firmware_updated
```

Lifecycle events (`juxta5-8-prod`) read in chronological order across a
shelf-wake → retrieve → production → magnet-shelf cycle:

- `day_start` — auto-emitted at the head of every new JXS pseudo-file
  (first creation, calendar rollover, post-`clearMemory`). Carries the
  current NVS snapshot via the standard JXS columns, so each day's data
  needs no cross-day lookup to interpret.
- `shelf_exit` — first row written after a magnet wake; emitted by
  `juxta_ble_datetime_synchronized()` once the gateway has supplied a valid
  clock (one-shot per boot).
- `user_connected` — every real BLE link-layer connection; deferred to the
  time-set moment when it arrives during the sync gate (before the clock is
  valid).
- `time_set` — every gateway-supplied timestamp write.
- `user_disconnected` — every real BLE link-layer disconnect.
- `boot` — production init complete (timers and BLE state machine starting).
- `shelf_entry` — operator held the magnet during production to enter shelf
  mode; written immediately before `enter_shelf_mode()`.
- **Gateway `clearMemory`** — erases all NOR CSV regions; **not** emitted as a
  JXS row. File creation and provenance are deferred to the next append
  (`boot`, vitals, or lifecycle event). A sync-gate clear before production
  is marked by the usual `day_start` → `user_disconnected` → `boot` sequence.
- `wdt_recovery_dog` / `wdt_recovery_sreq` / `wdt_recovery_lockup` — emitted
  immediately after `boot` when the production recovery branch fired with a
  valid retained-RAM RTC snapshot. The suffix matches the bit observed in
  `RESETREAS` (watchdog `DOG`, soft `SREQ` reboot, or CPU `LOCKUP`). The
  device skipped the magnet/gateway sync gate and resumed production
  automatically with `op_mode == PROD` confirmed in NVS.
- `wdt_recovery_no_rtc` — same recovery branch but the retained-RAM snapshot
  was invalid (cold-boot wipe, partial write, CRC mismatch). The device
  fell through to datetime sync and gathered a fresh clock from the gateway
  before re-entering production. Useful as a "I did recover but the RTC was
  lost" marker for downstream analysis.

This separates the two distinct "device left the radio" reasons that previously
both wrote `user_disconnected`: a real BLE disconnect (`user_disconnected`)
vs. an operator-initiated magnet shelf (`shelf_entry`).  The four
`wdt_recovery_*` events extend that audit trail across silent resets — a
unit with several `wdt_recovery_dog` rows in a day is immediately visible
at offload even if RTT was never attached.

## Subject ID Rules

`subject_id` must never be empty.

Default behavior:

```text
subject_id = device_id
```

Example default assignment:

```text
device_id  = JX_3FA2B7
subject_id = JX_3FA2B7
```

This guarantees:

- Every row always maps to a subject
- No null subject identifiers
- Unassigned devices still produce valid datasets

## Current Settings Cache

Current operating settings are additionally cached in the config region for fast access.

The JXS log serves as the historical append-only provenance record.

---

# Metadata / Directory Index

A small append-safe metadata region tracks pseudo-files.

## Directory Entry Fields

```text
filename
log_type
start_addr
length_bytes
start_unix
end_unix
flags
```

## Example

```text
JXV20260507.csv,V,0x020000,45210,1715126400,1715212799,closed
JXB20260507.csv,B,0x120000,66320,1715126400,1715212799,closed
```

---

# File Creation Rules

New pseudo-files are created when:

```text
date changes
schema changes
mode requires different columns
```

Examples:

```text
JXV20260507.csv
JXV20260508.csv
JXB20260507.csv
JXS20260507.csv
```

## Schema Change Behavior

If schema changes occur and today's file already exists:

- The existing file for today is erased
- Writing restarts at the beginning of today's file region
- Previous-day files remain untouched

This avoids complex schema migration logic.

---

# Write Behavior

## Rules

```text
append-only
no in-place edits
no row deletion
no row mutation
```

## EOF Marker

Closed files terminate with:

```text
#EOF
```

Advantages:

- Easier recovery
- Easier debugging
- Prevents stale flash ambiguity
- Simplifies export termination

## Advantages

```text
simple firmware
power-loss resilience
minimal flash wear
easy recovery
schema flexibility
```

---

# Export Behavior

During transfer:

```text
pseudo-files are reconstructed directly from flash regions
```

Because headers are physically stored in flash, exports require minimal transformation logic.

## Export Path Structure

During transfer/export, reconstructed files should be organized as:

```text
experiment/subject_id/filename
```

Example:

```text
social_v1/mouse_07/JXV20260507.csv
```

This structure is intended to simplify downstream analysis pipelines.

---

# Timekeeping Rules

## Primary Format

```text
Unix time (seconds)
```

## Time Source Events

Clock updates are logged using:

```text
time_set
```

Example:

```csv
1715200000,time_set,JX_9B10A1,mouse_07,social_v1,1.2.3,normal,30,60,JX_9B10A1
```

---

# Identity Model

## Device Identity

Stable hardware identifier.

Required format:

```text
JX_000000
```

Example:

```text
JX_3FA2B7
```

## Subject Identity

Experimental assignment.

Example:

```text
mouse_07
```

## Experiment Identity

Experiment grouping string.

Example:

```text
social_v1
```

## Identity Architecture

The BLE layer is device-centric.

The analysis layer is subject-centric.

BLE observations always store hardware device identities.

Subject mappings are reconstructed offline using timestamped JXS records.

## Analysis Join Strategy

Analysis software joins:

```text
JXB observer_id/peer_id
→ JXS device_id
→ subject_id
using timestamp windows
```

This allows:

- Device swapping without data corruption
- Stable BLE identities
- Reliable historical reconstruction
- Clean downstream analysis workflows
