# juxta5-8-prod

Production Hublink firmware for Juxta5-8 (nRF52840). Combines Hublink GATT BLE, append-only NOR CSV logging, and LIS2DH12 motion/temperature sensing. Settings persist in nRF52840 internal flash. **BLE radiated TX** defaults to **+8 dBm** via `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_ANTENNA` in the [`Juxta5-8_nRF52840`](../../boards/NeurotechHub/Juxta5-8_nRF52840/Juxta5-8_nRF52840_defconfig) board defconfig (when Bluetooth is enabled in the build).

Repository overview and bring-up apps: [`README.md`](../../README.md). NOR CSV field definitions: [`docs/JUXTA_NOR_Flash_Logging_Spec_v3.md`](../../docs/JUXTA_NOR_Flash_Logging_Spec_v3.md).

## Quick Start

End-to-end user flow as orchestrated by the **Voleo iOS app**. Magnet timing is enforced by firmware (`MAGNET_DEBOUNCE_MS = 3000` ms, `DFU_HOLD_THRESHOLD_MS = 10000` ms in [`src/main.c`](src/main.c)); see [Magnet gestures & LED feedback](#magnet-gestures--led-feedback) for the full reference.

1. **Shelf mode is the default.** Devices ship in ultra-low-power **System OFF**: no LED, no radio, ~9 µA at the battery. Applying a magnet is the only way to wake.
2. **Wake with a ~3 s magnet hold.** The LED lights **solid ON** the instant the magnet is sensed and drops **off at 3 s** as a "release now" commit cue. The device then enters connectable advertising with a **slow blink** (50 ms on / 450 ms off). Holds shorter than 3 s are rejected as false positives (a brush, RFID reader, or motor flyback cannot accidentally change state).
3. **In Voleo, scan and connect.** The LED switches to **solid ON** for the duration of the BLE connection.
4. **Time sync runs automatically; settings populate the app.** Voleo writes a timestamp on the Gateway characteristic, and the current device settings come back via the Node characteristic read. Tap **Push** to send any setting changes back.
5. **Disconnect to enter production.** On a clean disconnect after time sync, the device blinks **5×**, the LED turns off, and production starts (vitals, scan/advertise schedule, NOR logging). The LED is **off** throughout production.
6. **Return to shelf during production with a ~3 s magnet hold.** LED **solid ON** on apply → **off at 3 s** commit cue → **5× blink** → 5 s grace period → **one short confirmation blink** → device powers off into shelf mode (System OFF). A `shelf_entry` row is appended to JXS before power-off.
7. **Hold ≥ 10 s only to enter firmware update (DFU) mode.** Past the 3 s commit cue the LED stays off; at 10 s the device emits **3× blink** then **fast blink** (50 ms on / 50 ms off) and starts MCUboot SMP BLE advertising for nRF Device Manager. A subsequent confirmed 3 s magnet hold returns to shelf. Release the magnet between 3 s and 10 s if you only want to wake the device, not enter DFU.

## Build and flash

The user will build/flash and report any issues. `west` commands are only built into the nRF Extension (VS Code/Cursor).

RTT console is the primary runtime log (`CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y`).

## Defaults (NVS, first boot)

| Setting | Default | Range / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scan_interval_s` | 30 s | 0 = no passive scan; 1–120 s (clamped on save) |
| `adv_interval_s` | 5 s | 0 = no non-connectable adv; 1–120 s |
| `vitals_interval_s` | 60 s | Vitals timer period |
| `inactivity_multiplier` | 1 | 1–10; scales scan interval after zero-motion vitals window |
| `motion_logging` | 1 (on) | 0 = ignore motion IRQ/count, JXV `motion=0`, freeze inactivity multiplier |
| `subject_id` | `JX_XXXXXX` (device ID) | Gateway `subjectId` may override |
| `experiment` | empty | Gateway `experiment` |
| `upload_path` | `/` | Fixed placeholder in NVS blob |

Firmware version **`5.8.4`**; NOR schema **`jxta-nor-csv-v5`** (`JUXTA_LOGGING_VERSION` 5).

## Boot and State Machine

### Boot path

```
Power-on / Reset
      │
      ├─ RESETREAS == 0 (true POR: power loss, ESD, battery insertion)
      │         ├─ NVS op_mode == PROD AND valid NOR checkpoint draft
      │         │         └─→ POR production resume: restore RTC from draft,
      │         │             JXS por_recovery row, draft flushed as JXV row.
      │         │             Magnet not required; straight back to production.
      │         └─ otherwise (fresh unit, shelved unit, DFU, no draft)
      │                   └─→ Shelf mode (System OFF, MAG_INT wake). No LED.
      │
      ├─ RESETREAS[OFF] set (woke from System OFF via magnet)
      │         └─→ LED ON while magnet held → measure hold duration
      │                   ├─ < 3 s   → False positive: LED off on release → re-arm shelf (no datetime sync)
      │                   ├─ 3-10 s  → LED off at 3 s mid-hold (commit cue) → slow blink → Datetime sync phase
      │                   └─ ≥ 10 s  → LED off at 3 s → 3× blink → fast blink → DFU mode (MCUboot SMP BLE)
      │
      ├─ RESETREAS[DOG|LOCKUP|SREQ] (silent reset) AND NVS op_mode == PROD
      │         └─→ Production recovery boot:
      │                   ├─ retained RAM valid → restore RTC, JXS wdt_recovery_{dog,sreq,lockup}
      │                   ├─ retained RAM lost, valid NOR draft → restore RTC from draft,
      │                   │                                       JXS wdt_recovery_no_rtc
      │                   └─ retained RAM lost, no draft → datetime sync, JXS wdt_recovery_no_rtc
      │             Magnet not required; goes straight back to production loop.
      │
      └─ Other silent reset (DFU / SHELF saved mode) → existing post-reset behaviour.

After datetime sync (if required), production init requires NOR log + LIS2DH12:
      ├─ NOR or accel init OK  → vitals + scan/adv state machine, op_mode := PROD
      └─ NOR or accel init fail → long blink (1 s on / 1 s off) forever
```

### Production recovery boot

When the device is running production and suffers a **silent reset** (watchdog
`DOG`, CPU `LOCKUP`, or soft `SREQ` reboot), the next boot automatically
resumes production without requiring a magnet swipe or a gateway re-sync.
Driven by two persistent stores:

- **NVS `op_mode`** (one byte, separate key from the gateway settings blob):
  written `SHELF` at the top of every `enter_shelf_mode()`, `DFU` at the top
  of `enter_dfu_mode()`, and `PROD` once `juxta_ble_set_production_ready()`
  succeeds. The recovery branch only fires when this is `PROD`, so DFU and
  shelf-mode silent resets fall through to their existing flows untouched.
- **Retained-RAM RTC snapshot** (`__noinit` struct with magic + version +
  CRC32 in [`src/juxta_time.c`](src/juxta_time.c)). A 1 s `k_timer` refreshes
  `unix_time` + `k_uptime_get_ms` while production runs; on recovery
  `juxta_time_retained_unix()` projects the snapshot forward by the new boot's
  uptime so the recovered RTC is accurate to ≤1 s. Invalidated explicitly on
  every clean `enter_shelf_mode()` so a planned shelf entry never looks like
  a recoverable production boot.

Every recovery is auditable via a `wdt_recovery_{dog,sreq,lockup,no_rtc}`
row appended to JXS immediately after the `boot` row.

### POR production resume (fw 5.8.4)

Retained RAM does not survive a **true POR** (`RESETREAS == 0`) — until 5.8.4
a mid-session power loss (supply collapse, ESD, battery bounce) always routed
to shelf and silently ended the recording (see
[`CRASH_ANALYSIS_2026-07-09.md`](CRASH_ANALYSIS_2026-07-09.md) and the
Test18/Test19 truncated-vitals failures). Production now also checkpoints to
a store that survives power loss:

- **NOR checkpoint ring** ([`src/juxta_checkpoint.c`](src/juxta_checkpoint.c)):
  the last 64 KB of the external NOR (`0x3F0000–0x3FFFFF`, carved from the
  tail of JXB). The same 1 s timer that refreshes retained RAM also appends a
  32 B CRC-guarded record (unix time, motion count since the last JXV row,
  battery mV, temperature) — "draft vitals". 16 × 4 KB sectors, 128 records
  per sector: the head erases each sector as it enters it (~45 ms once per
  ~2 min), keeping ~34 min of history. Endurance ≈ 42 sector erases/day →
  years at typical 100k NOR P/E cycles. A record torn by the dying supply
  fails CRC and the previous second's record wins.
- **Resume decision** (Step 3, before any magnet logic): `RESETREAS == 0`
  AND NVS `op_mode == PROD` AND a valid draft in the ring → restore the RTC
  from the draft (boot time compensated; worst-case error ≈ 1 s + time power
  was actually out), skip the magnet and sync gates, and re-enter production
  directly. JXS gets `boot` + **`por_recovery`** rows, and the draft is
  flushed as a real JXV row timestamped at capture — the interrupted session
  loses at most ~1 s of vitals and its final motion count instead of up to a
  full vitals tick. A repeating electrical fault now writes one
  `por_recovery` row per hit, making persistence visible at offload.
- **Session isolation**: the ring is erased at every fresh production
  activation (before `op_mode := PROD`), on `clearMemory`, and at every
  `enter_shelf_mode()` (after `op_mode := SHELF`, so a power cut mid-erase
  still leaves the unit unrecoverable-by-design). A stale draft from an
  earlier session can therefore never resurrect a deliberately-ended one.

True battery insertion on a fresh or shelved unit still routes to shelf:
`op_mode != PROD` in both cases. The battery gate (3 consecutive samples
< 2750 mV) also still wins, so a genuinely dead battery cannot boot-loop.

### Datetime sync phase (normal wake only)

```
Slow blink (50 ms ON / 450 ms OFF) — waiting for iOS connection
      │
      └─ iOS connects
               │  LED: solid ON
               ├─ timestamp received via Gateway
               │         └─ wait for disconnect
               │                   └─ 5× blink → LED off → Production init
               │
               └─ disconnect without timestamp
                         └─ slow blink → restart connectable advertising
                                         (loops indefinitely until timestamp received)
```

### Production state machine

```
IDLE
 ├─ scan interval elapsed  → SCANNING (1 s passive burst) → flush JXB rows → IDLE
 ├─ adv interval elapsed   → ADVERTISING (1 s non-conn) → IDLE
 └─ iOS connects           → CONNECTED (radio owned by BT stack)
                                     └─ disconnect → IDLE

Parallel vitals timer (every vitals_interval_s):
  LIS2DH12 temp + SAADC batt_mv + motion count → append JXV row
```

### Scanning vs advertising (operational BLE)

After **production init** (`hardware_ready`), the device never runs **non-connectable advertising** and **passive scanning** at the same time. `**adv_interval_s`** and `**scan_interval_s`** are **any whole-second integer from 0 to 120** (no stepping): **0** turns off that modality; values **> 120** are clamped to **120** when saved. A `**k_timer`** (`state_timer`) wakes a `**k_work`** handler (`state_work_handler`) on a schedule; each invocation **tears down** whatever phase was active (stop adv and/or stop scan), returns to an internal **IDLE** bookkeeping state, then optionally starts **one** new phase.

**Phases (mutually exclusive on the radio during normal operation)**


| Phase                                            | What starts                                                                   | How long (`state_timer`)      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Cadence between passive scan bursts              | `**scan_interval_s`** (NVS / Gateway) | **0** = disabled; otherwise **1–120** s (any integer); compared against `last_scan_ts` in whole seconds (`juxta_time_now()`).                                                                         |
| BLE advertising event spacing (inside the burst) | **100–150 ms**                        | `interval_min` / `interval_max` = `BT_GAP_ADV_FAST_INT_MIN_2` / `BT_GAP_ADV_FAST_INT_MAX_2` (Zephyr `gap.h`: **0x00A0** / **0x00F0** in 0.625 ms units → **100 ms** / **150 ms** nominal).            |

**When both “due”, scan wins.** After going IDLE, the handler evaluates `**scan_due`** only if `**scan_interval_s` ≠ 0** (`juxta_time_now()` ≥ `last_scan_ts` + effective `**scan_interval_s`**), then `**adv_due`** only if `**adv_interval_s` ≠ 0** (≥ `last_adv_ts` + `**adv_interval_s`**). If both intervals are 0, periodic scan and non-connectable advertising are skipped and the state timer is not armed for them. If nothing applies, it programs the timer for the **earlier** of the next enabled scan vs adv deadline, plus a small **random jitter** (0–999 ms) to desynchronize colliding devices.

**Timing note:** `scan_due` / `adv_due` use `**juxta_time_now()` in whole seconds**, `; `**ADV_BURST_MS`** and `**SCAN_BURST_MS`** are both **1 s** wall-time bursts scheduled sequentially, not divisors of the interval. **Idle-period jitter** (0–999 ms on the next sleep) spreads peer wakeups when many devices use similar intervals; it does not randomize burst lengths.

**While an iOS client is connected** (`ble_connected`), the work handler **returns immediately** — the stack owns the connection; scan/adv cycling resumes from **IDLE** after disconnect (see `on_disconnected` in the same file).

**Magnet shelf path:** if the user holds the magnet (not connected), firmware stops adv and scan, forces **IDLE**, then enters shelf after the debounce sequence — same “radio off before shelf” idea.

### Measured current draw (battery terminals)

Average current **probed at the battery terminals** (µA). Bench setup: **+8 dBm** TX where noted (`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_ANTENNA` on this board); values depend on supply, RF environment, and build. **Est. 40 mAh lifetime** assumes a **40 mAh** LiPo and continuous drain at the stated average: **40 000 ÷ I_µA** hours (then shown as days or hours for readability). Does not include self-discharge, end-of-life voltage, or duty-cycle nuance on sub-minute burst rows. **Scan‑burst rows** below used **3** s `SCAN_BURST_MS` at measurement time; firmware now uses **1** s—expect lower average current (re‑bench to refresh numbers).

| **Fast blink** | 50 ms on / 50 ms off | DFU mode (magnet hold ≥ 10 s) |
| **Long blink** | **1 s on / 1 s off** (indefinite) | **Hardware fault**: external NOR log init failed, or LIS2DH12 init failed — device does not enter production |
| **Counted blinks** | 3× (DFU entry), 5× (sync OK, magnet shelf) | One-shot sequences via `led_blink()` |


### Hardware fault indication (long blink)

If **SPI NOR** logging cannot initialize (`juxta_log_init`, e.g. flash not ready, recovery/format failure) or the **LIS2DH12** cannot initialize (`init_accel`, SPI, motion IRQ, or interrupt config), firmware logs an error on RTT and enters **`LED_MODE_LONG_BLINK`**: **1 second on, 1 second off**, repeating forever. Production timers, vitals, and the scan/adv state machine **do not** start (`hardware_ready` stays false). The watchdog continues to be fed (10 s period). Power cycle or debug reset is required to retry.

This is distinct from **slow blink** (datetime sync) and **fast blink** (DFU).

## Magnet gestures & LED feedback

Every magnet detection site now requires a confirmed **3 s minimum hold**
(`MAGNET_DEBOUNCE_MS` in [`src/main.c`](src/main.c)). Sub-3 s touches are
treated as false positives — a transient brush, RFID reader, or motor flyback
will not cost the user a session. The DFU long-hold threshold is **10 s**
(`DFU_HOLD_THRESHOLD_MS`, raised from 7 s) so it sits well past the debounce
floor and is unambiguous when held deliberately.

**Commit-confirmed LED cue (boot-wake and production magnet monitor):** at
three of the four magnet detection sites — debug-shelf simulation, production
System OFF wake, and the production-loop magnet monitor — the LED is turned
solid ON the instant the magnet is detected, then driven low **as soon as
the hold crosses 3 s** as a tactile "commit confirmed" cue. The user may
release and the device commits to the next mode. On the boot-wake sites,
keep holding past 10 s and DFU mode re-lights the LED via its 3× blink +
fast blink. In the production-loop case the cue tells the user "release now
and the device will go to shelf — re-apply the magnet next time to engage
connectable advertising." The DFU exit monitor does not issue this cue
because `LED_MODE_FAST_BLINK` owns the GPIO and would overwrite any
one-shot drive on the next blink edge.

### iOS Hublink spec: `motionLogging`

Gateway-controlled diagnostic flag to isolate field issues from LIS2DH12 motion counting. **Default:** `motionLogging: true` (normal operation). Persisted in NVS until changed.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Disable motion IRQ counting/logging for isolation testing |
| **JXV effect** | `motion` column is always `0` while disabled |
| **Vitals** | Unchanged interval; `batt_v` and `temp_c` still logged |
| **Scan cadence** | Base `scanInterval` only (inactivity multiplier ignored while disabled) |
| **Accelerometer** | LIS2DH12 stays configured; IRQ may still fire but events are not counted |

**Disable motion logging** (deploy / isolation test) — write during sync-gate with `timestamp` and other deploy settings:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1783954810,
  "motionLogging": false,
  "scanInterval": 30,
  "advInterval": 5,
  "vitalsInterval": 60,
  "inactivityMultiplier": 5,
  "subjectId": "JX_A0E6B3",
  "experiment": "no-motion-test"
}
```

**Re-enable motion logging:**

```json
{
  "motionLogging": true
}
```

**Suggested iOS test flow:**

1. Connect → read Node → confirm `motionLogging: true` (default).
2. Gateway write `{"timestamp":…, "motionLogging": false, …}` + deploy settings.
3. Disconnect → device enters production.
4. Offload after 1+ vitals periods → JXV rows show `motion=0` even if device is moved.
5. Reconnect → Gateway write `{"motionLogging": true}` → verify JXV shows non-zero motion when moved.

### clearMemory semantics

`clearMemory` erases all NOR CSV regions (JXS, JXV, JXB) immediately, then
clears the POR-resume checkpoint ring (checkpointing restarts at slot 0).
The erase runs on the system workqueue and may take several seconds.

**No JXS row at erase time.** Provenance logging is deferred until the next NOR
append (`juxta_log_format()` in [`src/juxta_log.c`](src/juxta_log.c) resets
in-memory state only). When `clearMemory` is sent during the sync gate — before
production — there is nothing useful to record at erase time: the prior session
is intentionally discarded, and production entry marks the new package boundary.

**NVS settings are preserved** (`subjectId`, `experiment`, intervals, etc.).

**Recommended workflow:** finalize settings during the sync-gate connection, send
`clearMemory`, then disconnect to enter production. The first post-erase JXS
rows are typically:

```text
day_start          ← NVS snapshot (auto-emitted when the JXS file is created)
user_disconnected  ← sync-gate handoff
boot               ← production init
```

Fresh JXV/JXB files for the current calendar day are created on the first vitals
or scan append after production starts.

**During production:** `clearMemory` is honored but uncommon. The next vitals or
lifecycle append recreates dated files; prior rows are gone with no separate
erase marker in JXS.

---

### File listing (Filename characteristic)

Triggered by `"sendFilenames": true` in a Gateway write, or by writing `"LIST"` to the Filename characteristic directly. The device sends an **indication** with a semicolon-separated list:

```
JXS20260507.csv|2048;JXV20260507.csv|14592;JXB20260507.csv|30720
```

Each entry is `filename|size_in_bytes`. **Size** is the **CSV payload** byte count on File Transfer (no leading filename line, no NOR `#EOF` line in that count). A separate **standalone** File Transfer indication with payload `**EOF`** (3 ASCII bytes) follows all data indications and is **not** included in **size**.

---

### File transfer protocol (File Transfer characteristic)

1. iOS writes the desired filename to the **Filename** characteristic (e.g. `JXV20260507.csv`).
2. The device streams the file as a sequence of **indications** on the **File Transfer** characteristic.
  - Data payloads are **CSV only**: the first line stored on NOR (`filename.csv`) is skipped; indications start at the CSV header row. The NOR `#EOF` line is **not** sent as file bytes.
  - Each data indication payload is up to `min(MTU − 3, 512)` bytes (last chunk may be short).
  - The device waits for each indication confirmation before sending the next chunk.
3. After all data chunks, the peripheral sends **one** final indication on File Transfer whose value is exactly the string `**EOF`** (three bytes — gateway end-of-transfer marker). This is distinct from the Filename listing terminator `EOF` and from the `#EOF` line stored on NOR when a file closes.
4. iOS should request MTU exchange to 247 bytes for optimal throughput (~244 bytes per data indication).

Logging schema **`jxta-nor-csv-v5`** ([`src/juxta_prod.h`](src/juxta_prod.h)). JXS event rows include **`adv_interval_s`** (after `scan_interval_s`). Each new JXS pseudo-file leads with a `day_start` row that snapshots current NVS (subject, experiment, intervals) so the day is interpretable from JXS alone, without cross-referencing prior days. JXV and JXB stay strict CSV: a single column header followed by data rows only.

| Region     | Address               | Size    | Content                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| JXS        | `0x000000 – 0x00FFFF` | 64 KB   | Settings / events log                    |
| JXV        | `0x010000 – 0x10FFFF` | 1 MB    | Vitals log                               |
| JXB        | `0x110000 – 0x3EFFFF` | 2.94 MB | BLE observations log                     |
| Checkpoint | `0x3F0000 – 0x3FFFFF` | 64 KB   | POR-resume draft ring (not a CSV region) |


All regions are append-only CSV. Each pseudo-file is physically stored as:

```
JXSYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,event,device_id,subject_id,experiment,fw_version,scan_interval_s,adv_interval_s,vitals_interval_s,ble_name
1715200000,day_start,JX_9B10A1,JX_9B10A1,,5.8.4,30,5,60,JX_9B10A1
1715200000,boot,JX_9B10A1,JX_9B10A1,,5.8.4,30,5,60,JX_9B10A1
```

```
JXVYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,motion,batt_v,temp_c
1715200000,12,3.81,24
#EOF
```

Every new JXS pseudo-file (first boot of a region, calendar rollover, or after a `clearMemory` erase) opens with a `day_start` row carrying the NVS snapshot at file creation. JXV and JXB now contain only their column header and data rows — no `#`-prefixed comment lines — so any CSV parser that splits on commas works without special-casing.

```
JXBYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,observer_id,peer_id,rssi
1715200000,JX_9B10A1,JX_3FA2B7,-62
#EOF
```

Settings and the log-state cache live in nRF52840 internal flash (`storage_partition` at `0xF0000`, 64 KB) via Zephyr NVS.

## Validation checklist

Hardware + iOS session (also summarized in the repo [`README.md`](../../README.md)):

1. Flash `juxta5-8-prod` for `Juxta5-8_nRF52840`; RTT shows device ID, NVS load, NOR init. On the sync-gate connection JXS records `shelf_exit`, then `boot`, then any pending forensic rows (`crumb_*`, `pof_witness`), then `user_connected`, then `time_set`; after the gateway disconnects, `user_disconnected`. The boot identity is written the moment the clock becomes valid, so an offload during the sync connection already contains the current boot's rows.
2. Connect (nRF Connect or iOS). Node READ returns camelCase JSON; `firmwareVersion` starts with `5.8`.
3. Gateway `{"timestamp":…}` → `time_set` in JXS (preceded by the deferred `shelf_exit`, `boot`, forensic, and `user_connected` rows on the first sync of each boot).
4. Gateway `{"sendFilenames":true}` → Filename indication lists `JXS|…;JXV|…;JXB|…`.
5. Write a filename → File Transfer CSV stream (payload size matches listing) → final 3-byte `EOF` indication.
6. Wait one vitals period → JXV grows. Open a new day's JXS (or after `clearMemory`) and confirm the file leads with a `day_start` row carrying the current NVS snapshot (subject, experiment, intervals). JXV/JXB carry only their column header and data rows (no `#device_settings` lines).
7. Second `JX_XXXXXX` nearby during scan → JXB rows in RTT / NOR.
8. Gateway `{"clearMemory":true}` during the sync-gate session (after finalizing settings, before disconnect) → all NOR CSV regions erased; **no JXS row at erase time**. Disconnect into production; JXS opens with `day_start` → `user_disconnected` → `boot`. NVS settings unchanged (reconnect and read Node).
9. Power cycle → NVS settings and log cache reconcile without full NOR rescan.
10. **POR resume**: while production is running (no debugger), cut and restore battery power → device resumes production without a magnet; JXS shows `boot` + `por_recovery`, JXV shows a draft row timestamped ≤1 s before the cut, and the restored clock tracks real time to within a few seconds. A magnet shelf followed by a power cycle must **still** stay in shelf (`op_mode == SHELF` gates the resume).

## Diagnostics

The firmware emits a per-thread stack/CPU snapshot to RTT every vitals tick
(default 60 s, NVS `vitals_interval_s`) via Zephyr's built-in thread analyzer
([applications/juxta5-8-prod/prj.conf](prj.conf) `CONFIG_THREAD_ANALYZER=y`,
`CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y`, `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y`). The snapshot is
driven from `vitals_work_handler` in [`src/main.c`](src/main.c) so no extra
thread is created.

Example output (one block per 60 s):

```
<inf> juxta5_8_prod: vitals: thread_analyzer snapshot ↓
<inf> thread_analyzer: sysworkq        : STACK: unused 4612 usage 3580 / 8192 (43 %); CPU: 12 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: main            : STACK: unused 15104 usage 1280 / 16384 (7 %); CPU: <1 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: BT RX WQ        : STACK: unused 1924 usage 2172 / 4096 (53 %); CPU: 3 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: BT TX           : STACK: unused 1108 usage 428  / 1536 (27 %); CPU: 2 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: idle            : STACK: unused 220  usage 100  / 320  (31 %); CPU: 80 %
```

### How to read it

- `usage` is the **high-water mark** since boot — the deepest any call chain
  has driven that thread's stack pointer. Pre-fill (0xAA) means the analyzer
  can detect every byte that has ever been touched, not just current depth.
- `CPU` is averaged since the last sample.

### Thresholds

| Condition                                       | Action                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Any thread `usage > 80 %`                       | Investigate — small headroom, single deep call chain may overrun   |
| Any thread `usage > 95 %`                       | Imminent overrun; bump that thread's stack in `prj.conf` and reflash |
| Monotonic growth across hours                   | Possible recursion or local buffers expanding — instrument that code path |
| `idle` `CPU` collapses to 0 %                   | Some thread is busy-looping; check which one is climbing           |

### Crash signature

If RTT prints garbage with runs of `ª` (`0xAA`) followed by an MCUboot reboot,
that is the Zephyr stack sentinel pattern leaking out of an overrun stack —
the same byte that `CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y` writes into the unused region. The
**last `thread_analyzer:` block printed before the garbage names the thread
that overran** and how close every other thread was. Capture full RTT to disk
(J-Link RTT Viewer "Log to file" or `JLinkRTTLogger`) so the snapshot survives
a multi-day soak.

### What this does NOT capture

- No call-stack unwinding. The thread analyzer reports the high-water mark
  on each thread but not the call chain that drove the stack pointer. RTT is
  still the only place to see the stack-overrun sentinel (`0xAA`) directly.
- No effect on production: the analyzer is a read-only walk; no NOR writes,
  no BLE radio interaction.

### Persistent crash audit (post-recovery boot)

Since the production-recovery boot branch landed, every silent reset emits a
`wdt_recovery_{dog,sreq,lockup,no_rtc}` row to JXS on the next boot. A unit
with N of these rows in a day is immediately visible to the gateway operator
at offload — even if the operator never had RTT attached. Combine that with
the `LOG_PANIC()` thread-name print from `wdt_warn_cb` for a complete picture
of "who was running when the WDT tripped" + "did it recover".

Recovery boots no longer log a `shelf_exit` row (no magnet was involved), so
recovery boots are never masked as user wakes in the offloaded data.

### Forensic breadcrumbs (shelf-entry audit + supply-droop witness)

Previously the two *silent* shelf paths — fresh power-on (`RESETREAS == 0`,
i.e. a field POR) and the boot-time battery gate — left zero trace, making a
field power-blip indistinguishable from "never woken". Every shelf entry now
persists an NVS breadcrumb (reason, RESETREAS, boot counter, battery mV,
clock if set, POF flag) that the **next** valid-clock boot emits as a single
JXS row and then clears:

```
crumb_<reason> rr=0x<RESETREAS> n=<boot_count> mv=<batt_mv> pof=<0|1> t=<unix_at_shelf>
```

`<reason>` is one of `fresh_boot` (field POR → shelf), `batt_gate` (boot
battery gate), `false_positive` (sub-debounce wake), `magnet` (operator shelf
return), `dfu_exit`, `brownout` (vitals-tick low battery), `gateway_reset`.
The boot counter is a monotonic NVS value incremented once per boot — gaps
between consecutive `crumb_*` rows count the silent lives in between.

Since fw 5.8.4, a mid-production POR resumes the session instead of shelving
(see *POR production resume*), so it produces a `por_recovery` JXS row rather
than a `crumb_fresh_boot`. `crumb_fresh_boot` now indicates a POR on a unit
that was **not** in production (fresh/shelved/DFU unit, or no valid draft).

Independently, the nRF52840 **power-fail comparator** (POFCON) is armed at
every boot: VDDH threshold **3.6 V**, VDD threshold 1.7 V — just below the
1.8 V REGOUT0 rail, because a threshold at/above the rail keeps POFWARN
asserted and the errata-242 guard in the internal-flash driver then cancels
every NVS write with `-ECANCELED` (`src/juxta_pof.c`,
`CONFIG_NRFX_POWER`). With a debugger attached the POF is **not armed**
(same `CoreDebug` gate as the battery checks): bench boards typically run
without a battery, so VDDH would sit below 3.6 V and permanently assert
POFWARN. A supply sag below threshold fires an IRQ that updates
a `.noinit` witness (count + uptime + clock, CRC-guarded) which survives soft
resets. The next valid-clock boot reports it:

```
pof_witness n=<event_count> up=<uptime_of_last_event_s> t=<unix_of_last_event>
```

Interpretation for field failures: a reset **with** a `pof_witness` row =
supply droop preceded the reset; a clean POR (`por_recovery`, or
`crumb_fresh_boot` on non-production units) with **no** witness = ESD-class
event or instantaneous supply collapse. The battery gate
additionally requires **3 consecutive** low samples (5 ms apart) before
shelving, so a transiently-recovering supply no longer converts into a
multi-hour outage.

Both event strings are comma-free, so the JXS column layout is unchanged —
downstream parsers only see new event names.

| Production recovery boot    | After a silent reset (`DOG`/`LOCKUP`/`SREQ`) with NVS `op_mode == PROD`, the firmware restores the RTC from a retained-RAM (`.noinit`) snapshot (magic + version + CRC32) and re-enters production without requiring a magnet or gateway re-sync. If the snapshot is invalid, falls back to the NOR checkpoint draft, then to datetime sync. A `wdt_recovery_{dog,sreq,lockup,no_rtc}` row is appended to JXS for audit |
| POR production resume       | A true POR (`RESETREAS == 0`) with NVS `op_mode == PROD` and a valid draft in the NOR checkpoint ring resumes production directly: RTC restored from the draft (≈1 s accuracy + power-out time), no magnet or sync gate, JXS `boot` + `por_recovery` rows, draft flushed as a JXV row (final motion count + vitals of the interrupted session). Ring: last 64 KB of NOR, 32 B CRC records at 1 Hz, ~34 min history, erased at every activation / `clearMemory` / shelf entry. Fresh or shelved units (`op_mode != PROD`) still route to shelf |
| Op-mode persistence         | NVS-backed one-byte key (separate from gateway settings blob) tracks last committed mode: `SHELF` (top of `enter_shelf_mode`), `DFU` (top of `enter_dfu_mode`), `PROD` (after `juxta_ble_set_production_ready()`). Gateway field updates do not rewrite this byte and vice-versa, minimising flash wear |
| Retained-RAM RTC checkpoint | 1 s `k_timer` calls `juxta_time_retained_update()` from production; struct lives in `__noinit` section so it survives soft resets but is wiped by cold boot / System OFF.

| Daily file rotation         | `ensure_file()` in `[src/juxta_log.c](src/juxta_log.c)`: when the calendar date from `unix_time` no longer matches the active pseudo-file, the previous file is closed with `#EOF` and a new `*yyyymmdd.csv` is created. On each new **calendar day**, the first JXS/JXV/JXB append runs `touch_all_for_calendar_day()` so **all three** types get a dated file for that day. **JXS** new-file creation auto-emits a `day_start` row (NVS snapshot via the existing JXS columns) so the day is self-describing; **JXV/JXB** stay strict CSV (header + data rows only). Requires a valid clock; old files remain until Gateway `clearMemory`. **File-creation guarantee**: any JXS event with a valid clock (the first row written after a sync-gate is the auto-emitted `day_start`, immediately followed by `shelf_exit`) calls `touch_all_for_calendar_day` and creates JXS/JXV/JXB for today; rows logged with `unix_time == 0` are silently dropped. The `boot` row therefore always lands in an existing JXS file |

JXV/JXB stay strict CSV (header + data rows). Replaces the previous `#device_settings` JXV comment lines that broke single-header CSV parsing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
